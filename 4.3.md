# Problem
Given a circle segment with:

Angle = $\theta$ (radians)

Radius = R

Length of arc = s

$\theta = \frac{s}{R}$

Show that for small $\theta$:

a) $sin\theta \approx \theta$

b) $cos\theta \approx 1$

c) using $\frac{dy}{dx} = \displaystyle{\lim_{\Delta{x} \to 0}} \frac{y(x + \Delta{x}) - y(x)}{\Delta{x}}$, find the derivatives of $sin~x$ and $cos~x$

# a)

1. $\theta = \frac{s}{R}$, and $\theta$ is small; so for a given R s must also be small

2. If s is very small, the circle segment is almost like a triangle

3. $sin\theta = \frac{s}{R}$

4. $\displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}} ~ sin\theta = 0$

5. so when $\theta$ is close to zero, $sin\theta$ is close to zero as well

# b)
1. same as above
2. when s gets very small, $cos\theta = \frac{R}{R} = 1$

# c)
